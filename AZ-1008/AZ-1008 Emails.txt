Subject: General guidelines
---------------------------
Thank you for agreeing to help our team administer our Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environment.

We have some general guidelines that you must follow when you perform tasks. Please always use the following guidelines:
• When creating objects, use the default settings unless a different configuration is required to complete the task successfully.
• Only create, delete, or modify objects to achieve the stated requirements. Unnecessary changes to the environment can adversely affect your final score.
• If there are multiple approaches to achieving a goal, always choose the approach that requires the least amount of administrative effort.

Thanks,
Chief Technology Officer (CTO)




Subject: Existing environment
-----------------------------
We have an Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain named contoso.com that contains the following servers:
• DC1: Domain controller
• DC2: Future domain controller

An organizational unit (OU) named London contains all the user accounts in the domain.

Here are your admin credentials for accessing contoso.com:
User name: Contoso\Administrator
Password: Pa55w.rd

Thanks,
Network administrator




Subject: New domain controller for the Paris office
---------------------------------------------------
Hello,

We are opening an office in Paris and plan to deploy an additional domain controller to the new location.

This is your task:

You need to configure DC2 as an additional domain controller for contoso.com. The solution must meet the following requirements:
• Create a new site named Paris and associate a subnet of 172.16.1.0/24 to the site.
• Promote DC2 to be a domain controller
    Ensure that DC2 is assigned to the Paris site.
    Provide a Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password of Pa55w.rd.
• After DC2 is promoted, move the RID operations master role to DC2. You may need to complete this step after replication takes place between DC1 and DC2.

Thanks,
Project Management Team




Subject: Creating Paris objects for the contoso.com domain
----------------------------------------------------------
Hello,

We plan to simplify Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) management by ensuring that all the user accounts at the Paris office are
placed in an organizational unit (OU) named Paris. The Paris OU must also contain a universal group for managing administrators at the
Paris office.

A temporary contract user was recently hired to help manage the Paris office users. We plan to have the contractor use a generic account
named ParisContractor that will be granted permissions to perform the intended management tasks.

This is your task:

You need to create the domain objects for the Paris office. The solution must meet the following requirements:
• Create an OU named Paris that will contain a user object named ParisContractor and a universal group named Paris Admins.
• ParisContractor must have an expiration date of December 31, 2027, and be a member of the Paris Admins group.
• ParisContractor must be configured as a protected account.
• The Paris Admins group must be able to manage only the passwords of users in the Paris OU.

Thanks,
Project Management Team




Subject: Moving all Paris user objects to the Paris OU
------------------------------------------------------
Hello,

We have several user accounts that have the City attribute set to Paris. We plan to move these user accounts to the Paris OU.

This is your task:

You need to find all the user accounts that have the City attribute set to Paris and move them to the Paris OU. Ensure that the moved user
accounts have the following configurations:
• Are disabled after the move.
• Are forced to change their password at next logon.

Thanks,
Project Management Team




Subject: Updating password policy and Active Directory Recycle Bin settings
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello,

We plan to update the password policies of the contoso.com domain. Also, we need to be able to easily recover deleted Active Directory objects.

This is your task:

You need to increase domain security and reliability. The solution must meet the following requirements:
• Configure password policy settings to meet the following requirements:
    - All user accounts in the domain must have a password that has a minimum of 12 characters.
    - All members of the Domain admins group must be assigned a fine-grained password policy that specifies a password that has a minimum of 16 characters.
• Enable the Active Directory Recycle Bin.

Thanks,
Project Management Team





Subject: Using Group Policy to apply security settings
------------------------------------------------------
Hello,

We use Group Policy to manage the configuration and security settings for domain objects. We need to make changes to our Group Policy Object (GPO) settings.

This is your task:

First, you need to modify the Default Domain Controllers Policy GPO to ensure that the domain controllers deny all NTLM authentication requests to the domain.

Next, you need to create a new GPO named GPO1 that meets the following requirements:
• Must only apply to objects in the Paris OU.
• Audits unsuccessful logon events.
• Prevents the members of the Paris Admins group from being able to log on as a service to computers located in the Paris OU.

Thanks,
Project Management Team
